# ⚠️ Delete Nested ProofStack Directory

There is a nested `ProofStack/` directory that should be deleted.

## The Issue
- **Correct path**: `C:\Users\mattc\ProofStack\` ✅
- **Nested duplicate**: `C:\Users\mattc\ProofStack\ProofStack\` ❌

The nested directory is a duplicate and causes confusion.

## Why It Couldn't Be Deleted Automatically
VS Code or another process has a file lock on the directory.

## How to Delete It

### Option 1: Close VS Code and delete
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Open PowerShell
3. Run:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\mattc\ProofStack
Remove-Item .\ProofStack -Recurse -Force
```

### Option 2: Delete via File Explorer
1. Close VS Code
2. Open File Explorer
3. Navigate to `C:\Users\mattc\ProofStack\`
4. Delete the `ProofStack` folder inside it

## Files Already Saved
✅ All important files have been copied to the parent directory:
- `.env.local` (credentials)
- `.env.backup` (backup credentials)
- `CREDENTIALS.md` (documentation)
- `CREDENTIALS_QUICK_REF.md` (quick reference)

## After Deletion
The nested directory is already in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed even if it remains temporarily.
