# 🏗️ ProofStack Employer Platform - Database Schema Documentation

**Phase 1 Foundation Complete!**

This document explains the database architecture for ProofStack's two-sided talent marketplace.

---

## 📊 **Database Schema Overview**

### **New Tables Added (12 total)**

1. **organizations** - Company/employer profiles
2. **organization_members** - Team management
3. **professional_promotions** - Paid advertising system
4. **employer_reviews** - Employer → Professional reviews
5. **professional_ratings** - Aggregate rating calculations
6. **conversations** - Message thread containers
7. **conversation_participants** - Who's in each conversation
8. **messages** - Individual messages
9. **connections** - Connection requests between employers & professionals
10. **saved_candidates** - Employer bookmark system
11. **search_history** - Search analytics
12. **profile_views** - View tracking

### **Extended Existing Tables**

- **profiles** - Added employer platform fields:
  - `user_type` - professional | employer | organization
  - `organization_id` - Link to organization
  - `location` - Geographic location
  - `remote_available` - Works remotely?
  - `availability_status` - Job search status
  - `years_experience` - Experience level
  - `headline` - Professional tagline
  - `contact_preferences` - Communication settings

---

## 🎯 **User Type System**

### **Three User Types:**

```typescript
enum UserType {
  PROFESSIONAL = 'professional',  // Job seekers (current users)
  EMPLOYER = 'employer',           // Individual recruiters
  ORGANIZATION = 'organization'    // Company accounts
}
```

### **How They Work:**

- **Professional**: Creates portfolio, gets reviewed, can be promoted
- **Employer**: Can be individual or part of organization
- **Organization**: Company entity with multiple member users

### **Relationship:**

```
Organization (1) ─── (Many) Organization Members ─── (Many) Profiles (Employers)
                                                            
Profiles (Professionals) ─── Reviews ←── Profiles (Employers)
```

## 💰 **Promotion/Advertising System**

### **Promotion Tiers:**

| Tier | Price | Benefits | Visibility |
|------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Featured** | $99/mo | Top of search, profile badge, analytics | 10x |
| **Premium** | $49/mo | Priority placement, profile badge | 5x |
| **Standard** | $19/mo | Boosted visibility, profile badge | 2x |

### **Search Priority Algorithm:**

```
1. Featured Promotions (active, not expired)
2. Premium Promotions (active, not expired)
3. Standard Promotions (active, not expired)
4. Organic Results (sorted by relevance)
```

### **Table: professional_promotions**

```sql
professional_promotions
├── tier (featured/premium/standard)
├── starts_at / expires_at (time window)
├── is_active (boolean)
├── views_count, saves_count, messages_count (metrics)
└── stripe_payment_intent (payment tracking)
```

### **Helper Function:**

```sql
get_active_promotion(professional_id) → Returns highest active promotion
```

---

## ⭐ **Review & Rating System**

### **Review Flow:**

```
1. Employer works with Professional
2. Employer writes review (1-5 stars)
3. Review saves to employer_reviews
4. Trigger auto-updates professional_ratings
5. Professional profile shows aggregate rating
```

### **Review Constraints:**

- ✅ One review per employer per work period
- ✅ 48-hour edit window after posting
- ✅ Can mark as public/private
- ✅ Can report inappropriate reviews
- ❌ Employers do NOT get reviewed (one-way only)

### **Rating Calculation (Automatic):**

```sql
-- Trigger: update_professional_ratings()
-- Calculates on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE of reviews

professional_ratings
├── average_rating (1.00 - 5.00)
├── total_reviews (count)
├── [1-5]_star_count (distribution)
└── would_hire_again_percentage
```

### **Display Example:**

```
★★★★☆ 4.3 (27 reviews)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
★★★★★ ███████████ 15
★★★★☆ ████████     8
★★★☆☆ ███          3
★★☆☆☆ █            1
★☆☆☆☆              0

Would hire again: 93%
```

## 💬 **Internal Messaging System**

### **Three-Table Structure:**

1. **conversations** - The thread container
2. **conversation_participants** - Who can see/access
3. **messages** - Individual message content

### **Message Flow:**

```
Employer clicks "Contact" on Professional profile
    ↓
Connection request created (status: pending)
    ↓
Professional accepts
    ↓
Conversation + Participants created
    ↓
Both can send messages
    ↓
Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
```

### **Features Enabled:**

- ✅ Real-time message delivery
- ✅ Read receipts (last_read_at tracking)
- ✅ Unread count calculations
- ✅ File attachments (via Cloudinary)
- ✅ Archive/Mute conversations
- ✅ Block users (connection status: blocked)

### **Privacy:**

- **No external contact sharing** - All communication stays in-platform
- **RLS enforced** - Only participants can read/write messages
- **Connection required** - Must have accepted connection to message

---

## 🔗 **Connection System**

### **Connection Statuses:**

```typescript
type ConnectionStatus = 
  | 'pending'   // Employer sent, waiting for professional
  | 'accepted'  // Professional accepted, can now message
  | 'declined'  // Professional declined
  | 'blocked'   // Either party blocked the other
```

### **Connection Request Flow:**

```
1. Employer views Professional profile
2. Clicks "Contact" button
3. Modal opens with optional message
4. Connection created (status: pending)
5. Professional gets notification
6. Professional accepts/declines
   ├─ Accept: Conversation created, can message
   └─ Decline: Connection marked declined
```

### **Anti-Spam Rules:**

- ⏱️ 24-hour cooldown between requests to same person
- 🚫 Can't re-request after being blocked
- 📊 Rate limits based on employer tier

---

## 🔍 **Search & Discovery**

### **Search Filters Available:**

```typescript
{
  // Skills
  skills: ['React', 'TypeScript'],
  skills_match_type: 'all', // or 'any'
  
  // Experience
  years_experience_min: 3,
  years_experience_max: 10,
  
  // Location
  location: 'San Francisco, CA',
  remote_only: true,
  
  // Availability
  availability: ['available', 'open_to_offers'],
  
  // Quality
  min_rating: 4.0,
  verified_only: true,
  pro_only: true,
  
  // Promotion
  promoted_only: false
}
```

### **Search Result Ordering:**

```sql
ORDER BY
  -- 1. Promotion tier (highest first)
  CASE promotion_tier
    WHEN 'featured' THEN 1
    WHEN 'premium' THEN 2
    WHEN 'standard' THEN 3
    ELSE 4
  END,
  
  -- 2. Relevance score (skills match + rating)
  relevance_score DESC,
  
  -- 3. Recency
  last_active DESC
```

### **Promoted Badge Display:**

```html
<div class="profile-card">
  {promotion && (
    <span class="badge badge-{promotion.tier}">
      ⭐ {promotion.tier.toUpperCase()}
    </span>
  )}
  <!-- Rest of profile -->
</div>
```

## 📊 **Employer Subscription Tiers**

### **Pricing Structure:**

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 5 profile views/mo, 1 message/week, 0 saves |
| **Basic** | $99/mo | Unlimited views, 50 messages/mo, 10 saves |
| **Pro** | $299/mo | Unlimited, 3 team members, analytics |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited team, API access, white-label |

### **Usage Tracking:**

```sql
-- Middleware checks before allowing action
SELECT count(*) FROM profile_views
WHERE viewer_id = current_employer
  AND created_at > (now() - interval '1 month')

-- Compare against tier limits
IF count >= tier_limit THEN
  SHOW upgrade_modal
ELSE
  ALLOW action
END
```

---

## 🔐 **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies**

### **Security Principles:**

1. **Organizations**: Only members can view, owners can edit
2. **Reviews**: Public reviews visible to all, private only to author & subject
3. **Messages**: Only conversation participants can read/write
4. **Connections**: Both parties can view their connection
5. **Saved Candidates**: Only employer who saved can access

### **Example Policies:**

```sql
-- Messages: Only participants can read
CREATE POLICY "Participants can read messages"
  ON messages FOR SELECT
  USING (
    conversation_id IN (
      SELECT conversation_id FROM conversation_participants
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Reviews: Public + involved parties
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read public reviews"
  ON employer_reviews FOR SELECT
  USING (
    is_public = true 
    OR employer_id = auth.uid() 
    OR professional_id = auth.uid()
  );
```

---

## 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**

### **Indexes Created:**

```sql
-- High-traffic queries
CREATE INDEX idx_promotions_active 
  ON professional_promotions(is_active, expires_at) 
  WHERE is_active = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_professional 
  ON employer_reviews(professional_id) 
  WHERE is_public = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation 
  ON messages(conversation_id, created_at DESC);
```

### **Materialized Data:**

- **professional_ratings** - Pre-calculated, auto-updated via trigger
- **conversation.last_message_at** - Auto-updated via trigger
- **promotion metrics** - Incremented on view/save/message

### **Caching Strategy (Future):**

- **Redis cache** for active promotions
- **Search results** cached for 5 minutes
- **Rating displays** cached per professional

```

### **Step 3: Verify Tables Created**

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN (
    'organizations',
    'organization_members',
    'professional_promotions',
    'employer_reviews',
    'professional_ratings',
