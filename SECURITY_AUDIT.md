# ProofStack Security Audit & Hardening Plan

**Date:** October 20, 2024  
**Mindset:** Assume Breach - Defense in Depth  
**Status:** 🔴 Critical vulnerabilities identified, hardening in progress

---

## Executive Summary

ProofStack handles sensitive professional data including:
- Work samples (potentially containing proprietary code/IP)
- Personal professional information
- Employer-professional communications
- Financial data (Stripe transactions)
- Authentication credentials

**Critical Finding:** Current "encrypted" work sample system does not actually encrypt data, creating significant risk for confidential submissions.

---

## 🔴 Critical Vulnerabilities (P0 - Immediate Action Required)

### 1. **Fake Encryption in Work Samples**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/add_work_samples.sql`

**Issue:**
```sql
encrypted_content text, -- For 'encrypted' samples (AES-256)
```
- Field exists but no encryption is implemented
- Data stored in plaintext with label "encrypted"
- Employers trust their confidential work samples are encrypted when they're not
- Database compromise exposes all "encrypted" samples

**Impact:**
- Legal liability if confidential IP is exposed
- Loss of trust from employers
- Potential lawsuits from professionals whose work is leaked
- GDPR/privacy law violations if samples contain PII

**Fix:** Implement actual encryption using Supabase Vault or application-level encryption

---

### 2. **No Audit Logging for Sensitive Data Access**
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** All work sample access paths

**Issue:**
- No tracking of who views work samples
- No record of failed access attempts
- Cannot detect unauthorized access patterns
- Impossible to provide breach notification (legal requirement)

**Impact:**
- Cannot detect if breach occurred
- Cannot meet compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR Article 33)
- No forensic trail for investigations
- Elevated insider threat risk

**Fix:** Implement comprehensive audit logging table

---

### 3. **SECURITY DEFINER Functions Without Input Validation**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `get_work_sample_content()`, `get_professional_work_sample_stats()`

**Issue:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_work_sample_content(
  p_sample_id uuid,
  p_viewer_id uuid
)
RETURNS jsonb AS $$
-- Runs with SECURITY DEFINER (elevated privileges)
-- No validation that p_viewer_id matches auth.uid()
```

**Attack Vector:**
- Attacker can pass ANY viewer_id
- Could impersonate employer/professional
- Bypass RLS policies
- Access confidential samples

**Fix:** Validate that `p_viewer_id = auth.uid()` inside function

---

### 4. **RLS Policy Overlap and Data Leaks**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Multiple SELECT policies on work_samples

**Issue:**
```sql
-- Policy 1: Professionals can view their own
CREATE POLICY work_samples_professional_select ...
  USING (auth.uid() = professional_id);

-- Policy 2: Employers can view theirs
CREATE POLICY work_samples_employer_select ...
  USING (auth.uid() = employer_id);

-- Policy 3: Public samples visible to all
CREATE POLICY work_samples_public_select ...
  USING (confidentiality_level = 'public' AND verified = true);
```

**Problem:** Policies use OR logic - if ANY match, access granted. But:
- What if professional_id = employer_id (same person)?
- What if `verified = false` but user is professional?
- Can professionals see unverified samples before employer publishes?

**Fix:** Explicitly handle edge cases, add policy ordering

---

### 5. **No Secret Detection in Work Samples**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Work sample submission flow

**Issue:**
- Users can accidentally submit API keys, passwords, tokens
- Samples sent to OpenAI API (third party exposure)
- No scanning before storage or AI analysis

**Examples of what could leak:**
```javascript
// Work sample accidentally contains:
const API_KEY = "sk-proj-abc123..."; // Real OpenAI key
const DB_PASSWORD = "prod_password_123"; // Database creds
```

**Impact:**
- Credentials leaked to database
- Credentials sent to OpenAI (data processed by third party)
- Automated scanning bots can harvest exposed secrets
- Complete system compromise possible

**Fix:** Implement secret scanning before storage and AI analysis

---

## 🟠 High Priority Vulnerabilities (P1 - This Sprint)

### 6. **No Rate Limiting on Work Sample APIs**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `/api/work-samples/*`

**Issue:**
- Unlimited API calls per user
- Could scrape entire work sample database
- No protection against automated extraction
- DDoS vulnerability

**Attack Scenario:**
```javascript
// Attacker script
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  await fetch('/api/work-samples/' + randomUUID());
}
// Eventually finds valid UUIDs, extracts all data
```

**Fix:** Implement rate limiting (Upstash Redis already in project)

---

### 7. **Insufficient Input Validation**
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Location:** Work sample submission

**Issue:**
```sql
content text NOT NULL CHECK (char_length(content) >= 500 AND char_length(content) <= 2000)
```
- Only checks length, not content safety
- Could submit malicious JavaScript/XSS payloads
- Could inject SQL if rendered without escaping
- Could embed tracking pixels or malicious links

**Fix:** Content sanitization and validation

---

### 8. **Weak Session Management**
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Location:** Supabase Auth configuration

**Issues to verify:**
- Session timeout duration
- Refresh token rotation
- Device tracking
- Concurrent session limits

**Fix:** Review and harden auth configuration

---

### 9. **No Content Security Policy (CSP)**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** Next.js configuration

**Issue:**
- Missing CSP headers
- XSS attacks easier to execute
- Can't prevent unauthorized data exfiltration

**Fix:** Add strict CSP headers

---

### 10. **Sensitive Data in Client-Side Code**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** React components, API routes

**Potential Issues:**
- API keys in client code
- Excessive data exposure in API responses
- Debug logs containing sensitive info

**Fix:** Code audit + implement data minimization

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority (P2 - Next Sprint)

### 11. **No PII Detection**
- Work samples could contain names, emails, phone numbers
- GDPR compliance requires PII handling procedures
- **Fix:** PII detection and redaction

### 12. **Missing Security Headers**
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security
- **Fix:** Add security headers in next.config.js

### 13. **No Backup Verification**
- Are Supabase backups tested?
- Disaster recovery plan?
- **Fix:** Document backup/restore procedures

### 14. **Third-Party Risk (OpenAI)**
- Work samples sent to OpenAI API
- What's their data retention policy?
- Are we compliant with their ToS for confidential data?
- **Fix:** Review OpenAI DPA, consider self-hosted LLM for sensitive samples

### 15. **No Dependency Scanning**
- npm packages could have vulnerabilities
- Supply chain attacks
- **Fix:** Add `npm audit` to CI/CD

---

## 🟢 Low Priority (P3 - Technical Debt)

### 16. **Generic Error Messages**
- Could leak system information
- **Fix:** Standardize error responses

### 17. **No Intrusion Detection**
- Can't detect unusual patterns
- **Fix:** Consider adding monitoring/alerting

### 18. **Missing Security.txt**
- No responsible disclosure process
- **Fix:** Add `.well-known/security.txt`

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR (if serving EU users)
- ✅ Right to erasure (CASCADE deletes)
- ❌ Breach notification capability (no audit logs)
- ❌ Data minimization (need PII detection)
- ❌ Encryption at rest (fake encryption)

### SOC 2 (if pursuing enterprise customers)
- ❌ Audit trails required
- ❌ Access logging required
- ❌ Encryption required
- ❌ Incident response plan needed

### CCPA (California users)
- ❌ Data access requests (need comprehensive export)
- ❌ Data deletion (need verification)

## Assume Breach Principles Applied

1. **Zero Trust:** Don't trust internal or external users
2. **Least Privilege:** Minimal permissions by default
3. **Defense in Depth:** Multiple security layers
4. **Audit Everything:** Log all sensitive access
5. **Encrypt Everything:** At rest and in transit
6. **Validate Everything:** Never trust input
7. **Fail Securely:** Errors should deny access
8. **Separation of Duties:** No single point of failure

---

## Security Contacts

**Security Lead:** TBD  
**Incident Response:** TBD  
**Responsible Disclosure:** security@proofstack.dev (to be created)

---

## Next Steps

1. Review this audit with team
2. Prioritize fixes based on risk/impact
3. Implement Phase 1 critical fixes
4. Establish ongoing security review process
5. Consider security consultation/pentesting

**Remember:** Security is not a one-time fix, it's a continuous process.
