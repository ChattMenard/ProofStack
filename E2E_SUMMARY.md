- âœ… Mock analysis path verified and working
- âœ… Worker can run with: `npx tsx workers/analyzeSample.ts`

### 4. Files Created/Updated

**New Files:**
- `supabase/schema.sql` - Clean, production-ready schema
- `run-worker.js` - Helper to run worker with .env.local vars
- `E2E_SUMMARY.md` - This file!

**Updated Files:**
- `workers/analyzeSample.ts` - Fixed polling logic and error handling
- `TASKS.md` - Marked Week0 milestone complete
- `lib/supabaseServer.ts` - Already had defensive stub (works with real credentials)

## How to Run

### Start the Dev Server
```pwsh
npm run dev
```
Visit: http://localhost:3000

### Run the Worker
```pwsh
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://lytjmxjizalmgbgrgfvc.supabase.co"
$env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="<your-service-role-key>"
npx tsx workers/analyzeSample.ts
```

### Test Upload (via REST API)
```pwsh
$url = "https://lytjmxjizalmgbgrgfvc.supabase.co/rest/v1/samples"
$headers = @{
  "apikey" = "<your-anon-key>"
  "Authorization" = "Bearer <your-service-role-key>"
  "Content-Type" = "application/json"
  "Prefer" = "return=representation"
}
$body = @{
  type = "writing"
  title = "My Sample"
  content = "Sample content with skills: Python, JavaScript"
  filename = "test.txt"
  mime = "text/plain"
  size_bytes = 50
  visibility = "public"
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

## Next Steps (Week1)

Now that the foundation is solid, we can build on top:

1. **Auth UI Integration** - Wire up Supabase Auth in the upload form
2. **Upload API Route** - Create `/api/upload` endpoint (already scaffolded)
3. **Public Profile Pages** - Show user's verified skills
4. **Storage Integration** - Add Cloudinary or Supabase Storage for file uploads
5. **LLM Integration** - Connect real Ollama/OpenAI for skills extraction
