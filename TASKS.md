ProofStack — Task List and Roadmap
=================================

Purpose
-------

Single source of truth for the ProofStack MVP and next milestones. Use this file to track work, run weekly check-ins, and manage priorities. Update it as tasks complete.

How to use
---------

- Mark tasks as [ ] -> incomplete, [x] -> done.
- Keep owners and estimates short (e.g., @matt - 2d).
- Move items between sections as priorities change.
- Link to PRs/issues or files when complete.

- [ ] Start building in public on X/Twitter — @matt - ongoing
- [ ] Prepare Product Hunt assets and demo video — @matt - 2d

Launch

- [ ] Post on Product Hunt (best day Tue-Thu) — Marketing - 1d
- [ ] Hacker News Show HN post — Marketing - 1d

- See `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for complete details

Recurring tasks & cadence
-------------------------

- Weekly: Sprint review + update `TASKS.md` (1h) — Owner: @matt
- Weekly: Check queue/backlog failures and retry (30m)
- Bi-weekly: Security dependency check (30m)
- Monthly: Cost review & infra scaling plan (1h)

Daily quick-check (5 minutes)
-----------------------------

- Are there failed analysis jobs? (Check worker logs)
- Any 500 errors in API or failing deploys? (Sentry/monitor)
- New auth signups or GitHub link failures?

Release checklist (for public deploy)
------------------------------------

- [ ] All critical security/privacy items done
- [ ] Tests passing (unit + smoke)
- [ ] Monitor & rollback plan documented
- [ ] Update `README.md` with public demo link

Acceptance criteria examples
---------------------------

Sign-in & auth

- Users can sign up with email and/or GitHub
- Session persists across pages

Upload & analysis

- Users can upload a file and receive a queued job
- Analysis returns a JSON `skills` object with at least one skill and an evidence link

Proofs

- Each public sample shows a hash + server-signed proof metadata

Metrics to track (KPIs)
-----------------------

- Time-to-first-proof (ms)
- % profiles with at least one verified skill
- Average analysis processing time
- MRR and conversion rate (once premium exists)

Project management suggestions
-----------------------------

- Track issues in GitHub Issues + a Project board (Kanban)
- Use small PR size, require at least one reviewer
- Create milestone tags (week0, week1, month1)
- Use `TASKS.md` for the canonical checklist and link tasks to issues/PRs

Weekly review template (use this during 1h weekly sync)
-------------------------------------------------------

1. What did we finish since last check? (link PRs)
2. What's blocked? (list blockers & owners)
3. What will we do next week? (top 3 priorities)
4. Any infra/scale/PR concerns?
5. Quick KPI snapshot (errors, jobs failing, signups)

Next actions I can take now
--------------------------

- Complete unit tests for API routes (upload, analyze, github endpoints)
- Add E2E smoke test with Playwright for sign-in -> upload -> analysis flow
- Deploy to Vercel and configure environment variables
- Implement basic monitoring with Sentry and analytics with PostHog
- Address security/privacy items before public launch (Terms, DMCA, data deletion)
