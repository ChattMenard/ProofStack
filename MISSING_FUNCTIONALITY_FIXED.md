# Missing Functionality - Fixed âœ…

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Commit:** 8c34b63

## What Was Broken

Several features had navigation links but no actual pages, creating a frustrating user experience with 404 errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. âœ… Professional Messages Navigation
- **Issue:** Messages page existed but no link in professional dropdown
- **Fix:** Added "ðŸ’¬ Messages" link to professional navigation menu
- **File:** `components/UserProfile.tsx`

### 2. âœ… Employer Saved Candidates Page
- **Issue:** Save functionality worked, but no page to view saved professionals
- **Fix:** Created full saved candidates page with:
  - View all saved professionals
  - Private notes for each candidate
  - Quick actions: View Portfolio, Send Message, Remove
  - Empty state with call-to-action
- **File:** `app/employer/saved/page.tsx` (NEW - 274 lines)

### 3. âœ… Contact Buttons on Portfolio Pages
- **Issue:** Portfolios were view-only, no way for employers to reach out
- **Fix:** Added context-aware action buttons:
  - **For logged-in employers:** "Send Message" + "Write Review" buttons
  - **For non-logged-in visitors:** "Sign In to Contact" + "Hire Talent" CTAs
- **File:** `app/portfolio/[username]/page.tsx`

### 4. âœ… Employer Settings Page
- **Issue:** Settings link in navigation went to 404
- **Fix:** Created comprehensive settings page with:
  - Company profile management
  - Industry, size, location fields
  - Website and description
  - Founding employer badge display
- **File:** `app/employer/settings/page.tsx` (NEW - 318 lines)

## Impact

âœ… **All employer navigation links now functional**
âœ… **Professionals can access messages from menu**
âœ… **Public portfolios now have clear CTAs**
âœ… **Saved candidates feature is complete end-to-end**
âœ… **Employers can manage company profiles**

## Still Pending (Lower Priority)

- LinkedIn OAuth configuration in Supabase dashboard (code ready, needs admin config)
