✅ Rate limiting active  
✅ Admin access secured  
✅ Stripe webhooks verified

## 💰 Cost Protection

### Set Budget Alerts NOW
1. **Vercel:** Settings → Usage → Set alert at $50/month
2. **Supabase:** Organization → Billing → Set alert at $50/month
3. **OpenAI:** Account → Usage limits → Set hard cap at $100/month
4. **Stripe:** Just 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (no fixed cost)

### Expected Monthly Costs
- Vercel: ~$20/month
- Supabase: ~$25/month  
- OpenAI: ~$50-200/month (depends on usage)
- **Total: $95-245/month**

### Emergency Kill Switch
If costs spike, immediately:
1. Go to OpenAI dashboard → Disable API key
2. Vercel → Pause deployments
3. Supabase → Disable public API access
4. You won't lose data, just pause traffic

## 🚀 Launch Steps

### 1. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Already done! Your push to fix branch triggered deployment
# Check: https://vercel.com/your-dashboard
```

### 2. Google Play Console
1. Create developer account ($25 one-time fee)
2. Create new app
3. Fill in store listing (use content above)
4. Upload screenshots
5. Submit for review (takes 3-7 days)

### 3. Post-Launch Monitoring
- Check Vercel Analytics daily for first week
- Monitor Supabase usage
- Watch OpenAI costs
- Respond to user feedback
- Fix bugs quickly

## 📞 If Something Breaks

### Quick Fixes
- **Site down?** Check Vercel dashboard for deployment errors
- **Database error?** Check Supabase dashboard for connection issues
- **Payment failing?** Check Stripe dashboard for webhook errors
- **AI not working?** Check OpenAI API key and rate limits

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If new deployment breaks something:
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or in Vercel dashboard:
# Deployments → Click previous deployment → Promote to Production
```
