# Pre-Launch Checklist for Matt

## 📊 UI & Site Progress Snapshot (Updated October 26, 2025)

### ✅ Recently Wrapped Up

- **Homepage polish** – Hero, header, stats, and footer redesigned with gradients, animations, and improved spacing for a premium feel.
- **Global micro-interactions** – New hover/focus states, animated feature cards, floating background elements, and Scroll-to-Top control deployed.
- **Navigation fixes** – Professional menu now links to Messages, employer sidebar routes to Saved Candidates and Settings without 404s.
- **Portfolio contact CTAs** – Employers see direct “Send Message” and “Write Review” actions; visitors get clear sign-in prompts.
- **Employer settings overhaul** – Full company profile editor (industry, size, location, website, founding badge) now live.
- **Code cleanup** – Deprecated animated background and broken task marketplace removed to prevent runtime crashes.

### 🔜 Next Focus Items

- ✅ **ProofScore V2 Integration** – All pages now use ProofScoreV2 component (verified no V1 imports)
- ✅ **AI Analysis Triggers** – Profile saves and first messages automatically trigger analysis in background
- ✅ **LinkedIn OAuth** – Configured in Supabase with real credentials, button active in UI
- ⏳ **Post-enhancement QA** – Run through employer/professional dashboards to verify new navigation, CTAs, and animations behave across mobile and desktop
- ⏳ **Accessibility + performance pass** – Audit focus states, prefers-reduced-motion fallbacks, and Lighthouse scores after the visual upgrades

**Status:** See `UI_AND_FUNCTIONALITY_STATUS.md` for complete integration details and test plan.

## ✅ COMPLETED - Ready for Launch

### Critical Security Fixes (DONE)

- [x] **PWA Manifest Created** – `manifest.json` with all required fields
- [x] **App Icons Generated** – 8 sizes from 72px to 512px
- [x] **Service Worker Added** – Offline capability enabled
- [x] **Admin Email Fixed** – Moved from hardcoded to database field
- [x] **Secret Detection** – Prevents API keys/passwords in uploads
- [x] **Input Sanitization** – DOMPurify blocks XSS attacks
- [x] **File Validation** – Checks size, type, malicious content
- [x] **Fake Encryption Removed** – Migration created to clean up

### What You Need to Do (30 minutes total)

#### 1. Run Database Migrations (5 min)

Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Paste and run:

```sql
-- File 1: supabase/migrations/add_is_admin_field.sql
-- Copy/paste the entire file and run

-- File 2: supabase/migrations/remove_fake_encryption.sql
-- Copy/paste the entire file and run
```

**Verify:** Run this to confirm:

```sql
SELECT is_admin, email FROM profiles WHERE email = 'mattchenard2009@gmail.com';
-- Should return: is_admin = true
```

**Troubleshooting:** If you get `column "is_admin" does not exist`, re-run the `supabase/migrations/add_is_admin_field.sql` script and confirm the column was added with:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'is_admin';
```

When that returns a row, rerun the verification query above.

#### 2. Test PWA Installation (10 min)

1. Deploy to Vercel (it will auto-deploy from GitHub)
2. Open <https://proofstack.com> on your Android phone
3. You should see “Add to Home Screen” prompt

You need:

✅ API keys detected and blocked  
✅ XSS attacks prevented  
✅ File uploads validated  
✅ Rate limiting active  
✅ Admin access secured  
✅ Stripe webhooks verified  
✅ Authentication via Supabase  
✅ HTTPS enforced  
✅ Legal compliance (GDPR/CCPA)

### Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

- ⚠️ Rate limiting uses in-memory store (works for single instance)
- ⚠️ No audit logging yet (add within 30 days)

## 💰 Cost Protection

### Set Budget Alerts NOW

1. **Vercel:** Settings → Usage → Set alert at $50/month
2. **Supabase:** Organization → Billing → Set alert at $50/month
3. **OpenAI:** Account → Usage limits → Set hard cap at $100/month
4. **Stripe:** Just 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (no fixed cost)

### Expected Monthly Costs

- Vercel: ~$20/month
- Supabase: ~$25/month  
- OpenAI: ~$50–200/month (depends on usage)
- **Total: $95–245/month**

### Emergency Kill Switch

If costs spike, immediately:

1. Go to OpenAI dashboard → Disable API key
2. Vercel → Pause deployments
3. Supabase → Disable public API access
4. You won't lose data; just pause traffic

## 🚀 Launch Steps

### 1. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Already done! Your push to fix branch triggered deployment
# Check: https://vercel.com/your-dashboard
```

### 2. Google Play Console

1. Create developer account ($25 one-time fee)
2. Create new app
3. Fill in store listing (use content above)
4. Upload screenshots
5. Submit for review (takes 3–7 days)

### 3. Post-Launch Monitoring

- Check Vercel Analytics daily for first week
- Monitor Supabase usage
- Watch OpenAI costs
- Respond to user feedback
- Fix bugs quickly

## 📞 If Something Breaks

### Quick Fixes

- **Site down?** Check Vercel dashboard for deployment errors
- **Database error?** Check Supabase dashboard for connection issues
- **Payment failing?** Check Stripe dashboard for webhook errors
- **AI not working?** Check OpenAI API key and rate limits

### Rollback Plan

```bash
# If new deployment breaks something:
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or in Vercel dashboard:
# Deployments → Click previous deployment → Promote to Production
```
