## üîç Database Verification

### Check Attempts Recorded
```sql
-- See all hire attempts
SELECT 
  ha.*,
  p.username as professional_name,
  eo.name as employer_org_name
FROM hire_attempts ha
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = ha.professional_id
JOIN employer_organizations eo ON eo.id = ha.employer_org_id
ORDER BY ha.attempted_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Organization Counters
```sql
-- See employer attempt counts
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  subscription_tier,
  hire_attempts_count,
  hire_attempts_limit,
  last_hire_attempt_at,
  is_founding_employer
FROM employer_organizations
WHERE hire_attempts_count > 0
ORDER BY hire_attempts_count DESC;
```

### Test Functions
```sql
-- Check if specific employer can hire
SELECT can_employer_hire('your-org-id-here'::uuid);

-- Expected response (free tier with 2 attempts used):
-- {
--   "can_hire": true,
--   "reason": "Free tier - 1 attempts remaining",
--   "attempts_used": 2,
--   "attempts_remaining": 1,
--   "limit": 3,
--   "is_unlimited": false
-- }

-- Expected response (limit reached):

--   "attempts_used": 3,
--   "attempts_remaining": 0,
--   "limit": 3,

-- {
--   "can_hire": true,
--   "reason": "Unlimited (Pro/Founding)",
--   "attempts_remaining": 999,
--   "is_unlimited": true
-- }
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Organization not found"
- Check `profiles` table has `organization_id` set
- Verify employer completed signup flow
- Check `employer_organizations` table exists

### Widget not showing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoint is working: `/api/employer/check-hire-limit?employer_org_id=XXX`
- Check Supabase functions are deployed

### Button not blocking
- Verify migration applied successfully
- Check browser Network tab for API calls
- Ensure `HireLimitGuard` is wrapping the button correctly
- Check `currentUser` and `employerOrg` are loaded

### Counter not incrementing
- Check `hire_attempts` table for new records
- Verify `was_successful` is set correctly
- Check trigger function is installed
