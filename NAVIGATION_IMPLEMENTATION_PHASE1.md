4. **Accessibility**: Both marketplaces always visible to all users
5. **Professional**: Industry-standard terminology (matches Upwork, Toptal, etc.)

## 📝 Still To Do (Phase 2)

### Database Level (Optional - can stay as 'professional' internally)
- [ ] Consider migrating `profiles.user_type` from 'professional' to 'talent'
- [ ] Update RLS policies if user_type changes
- [ ] Update API responses

### Additional UI Updates
- [ ] Update professional dashboard pages
- [ ] Update employer discovery page
- [ ] Update review/rating pages
- [ ] Update email templates
- [ ] Update marketing pages (pricing, about, home)
- [ ] Update documentation files

### Route Migration (Phase 3 - Future)
- [ ] Create `/talent-marketplace` route (redirect from `/portfolios`)
- [ ] Create `/job-marketplace` route (redirect from `/projectlistings`)
- [ ] Create `/talent/*` routes (redirect from `/professional/*`)
- [ ] Add 301 redirects in `next.config.js`
