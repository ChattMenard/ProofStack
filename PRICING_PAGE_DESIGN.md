## 📊 Pricing Strategy

### Free Tier (Lead Generation)
**Purpose**: Capture email, build trust, demonstrate value
- Low barrier to entry
- Enough value to be useful
- Clear limitations to encourage upgrade

### Pro Tier (Revenue Generator)
**Purpose**: Monetize serious users
- $9.99/month or $89.99/year
- 25% discount on yearly (saves $29.89)
- All features unlocked
- Professional tier positioning

**Pricing Psychology**:
- Anchoring: Free makes $9.99 seem reasonable
- Decoy effect: Yearly savings makes it attractive
- Scarcity: Unlimited vs limited samples
- Social proof: "MOST POPULAR" badge

## 💰 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimate
```
100 monthly visitors to /pricing
× 5% conversion to Pro
= 5 new Pro subscribers/month
× $9.99/month
= $49.95 MRR

Annual: $599.40 ARR from month 1
Year 1 (with growth): ~$3,000-5,000 ARR
```

### Optimistic Estimate
```
500 monthly visitors to /pricing
× 10% conversion to Pro
= 50 new Pro subscribers/month  
× $9.99/month
= $499.50 MRR

Annual: $5,994 ARR from month 1
Year 1 (with growth): ~$30,000-50,000 ARR
```
