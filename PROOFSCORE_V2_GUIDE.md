## Database Functions

### `calculate_proof_score_v2(professional_id uuid)`
Calculates ProofScore using 30/30/40 split.

Returns:
```json
{
  "proof_score": 87.5,
  "breakdown": {
    "communication_quality": { "total": 26, "profile_quality": 8.5, ... },
    "historical_performance": { "total": 25, ... },
    "work_quality": { "total": 36.5, ... }
  }
}
```

### `update_professional_proof_score_v2(professional_id uuid)`
Updates professional_ratings table with new score.
Auto-called by triggers when:
- Profile quality score changes
- Review metrics change
- New reviews added

## Triggers

### `trigger_auto_update_proof_score_v2`
- Table: `professional_ratings`
- Event: INSERT or UPDATE
- Action: Recalculate ProofScore

### `trigger_profile_quality_score_update`
- Table: `profiles`
- Event: UPDATE of profile_quality_score
- Action: Recalculate ProofScore

## Migration Path

1. Apply `add_proof_score_v2.sql` migration
2. Existing ProofScore data preserved (uses old calculation if new fields empty)
3. New calculations kick in as:
   - Professionals save profiles (triggers profile analysis)
   - Professionals send first messages (triggers message analysis)
   - Employers complete new review format

## Usage Examples

### Analyze Profile on Save
```typescript
// In profile save handler
await fetch('/api/professional/analyze-profile', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    bio: profileData.bio,
    headline: profileData.headline,
    skills: profileData.skills
  })
})
```

### Analyze First Message
```typescript
// In message send handler
if (isFirstMessageToEmployer) {
  await fetch('/api/professional/analyze-message', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message_id: newMessage.id,
      professional_id: sender.id,
      message_text: messageContent
    })
  })
}
```

### Display ProofScore with Breakdown
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('calculate_proof_score_v2', { p_professional_id: userId })

// Show score: data.proof_score
// Show breakdown: data.breakdown.communication_quality.total, etc.
```

## Benefits Over V1

âœ… **More Predictive** - 40% weight on actual work quality vs 20% in V1  
âœ… **Early Signal** - Profile quality scored before first project  
âœ… **Fair to New Users** - Can earn points from good profile/communication  
âœ… **Catches Red Flags** - Poor grammar/spelling detected automatically  
âœ… **Incentivizes Quality** - Professionals know writing matters  
âœ… **Data-Driven** - AI provides consistent, objective text analysis  

## Cost Considerations

- OpenAI API: ~$0.001 per analysis (GPT-4-mini)
- Profile analysis: Once per save (~$0.001)
- Message analysis: Once per first contact (~$0.001)
- Estimated: $1 per 1000 analyses

Very affordable for the value provided! ðŸš€
